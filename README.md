Prepping for....stuff.

Well I am just writing this because the guide says I have to write about myself. But what is "myself" and what exactly is writing? Why is the word writing written with a "w"? Shouldn't it be riting, wright? Or am I rong? Well English is a weird language, LEICSTER SHOULD BE LESTER BUT IT'S NOT. They had a name for this thing, but I don't know.

Hi I'm Chris.
